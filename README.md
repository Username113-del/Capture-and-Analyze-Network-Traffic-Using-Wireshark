# Capture-and-Analyze-Network-Traffic-Using-Wireshark
Wireshark is a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic. It captures packets in real-time, displaying detailed protocol information. Users can filter, inspect, and troubleshoot network issues, making it ideal for diagnosing connectivity problems, monitoring activity, and ensuring security.
Steps Performed





Started Capture: Initiated packet capture on the active network interface (eth0) using Wireshark.



Generated Traffic: Created network activity by browsing websites (e.g., mozilla.net, google.com) and pinging servers.



Stopped Capture: Halted the capture after approximately one minute.



Filtered Packets: Applied filters to isolate HTTP, DNS, and TCP protocols.



Identified Protocols: Recognized HTTP (web requests), DNS (domain resolution), and TCP (data transmission) in the capture.



Exported Capture: Saved the traffic data as network_capture.pcap.



Summarized Findings: Documented details of packet types and behaviors.
